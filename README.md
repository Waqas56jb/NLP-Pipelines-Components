## 🌐 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Journey 🚀

**## Hi Folks!** 👋  
Welcome to my NLP learning repository! This is where I document my journey into the fascinating world of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. As a beginner, I'm excited to dive into this field, exploring various concepts, tools, and applications that power modern AI systems. This repo serves as a collection of my projects, code snippets, notes, and learnings along the way.

## 📚 What’s Inside?  
**### 1. Tokenization 📝**  
- Understanding how text is broken down into tokens, which are the basic building blocks for further analysis in NLP.  
- Code examples demonstrating tokenization using different libraries.

**### 2. NLP Pipelines 🔄**  
- Detailed exploration of NLP pipelines, which are sequences of processes that convert raw text into structured data.  
- Examples include how to build and customize pipelines for specific tasks.

**### 3. Named Entity Recognition (NER) 🏷️**  
- Implementation of NER models to identify entities like **Organizations (ORG)**, **Geopolitical Entities (GPE)**, and **Monetary Values (MONEY)** within text.  
- Visualization of NER results using SpaCy’s `displaCy` tool.

**### 4. Dependency Parsing 🕸️**  
- Techniques to understand and represent the grammatical structure of sentences.  
- Code examples that show how to extract relationships between words.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python 🐍**: The primary language used for NLP tasks in this repository.  
- **SpaCy**: A powerful NLP library for Python that provides easy-to-use functions for various NLP tasks.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks 📓**: All code and examples are provided in interactive notebooks for easy exploration.

## 🔍 Why NLP?  
Natural Language Processing is a critical area in AI that enables machines to understand and interact with human language. From chatbots to sentiment analysis, NLP is the backbone of many innovative technologies. This repository is my step-by-step guide to mastering these concepts and applying them to real-world problems.

## 🚧 Next Steps  
As I continue to learn, this repository will grow with more advanced topics such as **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)**, **Sentiment Analysis**, **Text Classification**, and beyond. Stay tuned for more updates! 🌟
